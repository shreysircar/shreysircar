## 💡 Fun Facts

- I built a music app that plays your favorite tracks and shows trending videos — it’s like Spotify and YouTube teamed up, and I brought them to life with Flutter magic.
- Still waiting for Spotify to hit me up (👀)  
- When I'm not coding, I’m either composing, remixing, or planning my next tech + music fusion

## 🏁 Final Words

> “I build like an engineer and feel like an artist.”

_Still here? Take a deep breath, vibe to your favorite song, and then let’s build something extraordinary._

🌿 Stay Curious. Stay Musical. Stay You.
